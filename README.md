# Explore ML in Cairo 1.0 ![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-green.svg)

Build neural network models in Cairo 1.0 to perform inference.

---

The calculations are performed using `i33` values, and the outcomes are quantized into 8 bits based on the [ONNX standard for symmetric quantization](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/performance/quantization.html#quantization-overview).

## Installation

Follow the [**`auditless/cairo-template`**](https://github.com/auditless/cairo-template) instructions.

## Cairo Version
- [Cairo](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha.4) v1.0.0-alpha.4

## How to use it?

### Build

Build the code.

```bash
$ make build
```

### Test

Run the tests in `src/tests`:

```bash
$ make test
```
